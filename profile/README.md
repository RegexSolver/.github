RegexSolver is a comprehensive toolkit designed for working with regular expressions, enabling you to manipulate them as sets.

We provide a range of open-source API wrappers in different programming languages, making it easier for developers to integrate our services into their applications.

We also provide the engine as an opensource Rust library.

## Features

- **Intersection**: Find the common patterns between multiple regular expressions.
- **Union**: Combine multiple regular expressions into a single, unified expression.
- **Subtraction/Difference**: Subtract one regular expression from another.
- **Equivalence**: Determine if two regular expressions match the same set of strings.
- **Subset**: Check if one regular expression is a subset of another.

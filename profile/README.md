RegexSolver is a comprehensive toolkit designed for working with regular expressions, enabling you to manipulate them as sets.

Our engine running on our server is implemented in Rust and is continuously improved to provide the best performance.

We provide a range of open-source API wrappers in different programming languages, making it easier for developers to integrate our services into their applications.

Currently, RegexSolver is available for free during our public beta/early access phase, allowing us to gather feedback and make necessary enhancements.

## Features

- **Intersection**: Find the common patterns between multiple regular expressions.
- **Union**: Combine multiple regular expressions into a single, unified expression.
- **Subtraction/Difference**: Subtract one regular expression from another.
- **Equivalence**: Determine if two regular expressions match the same set of strings.
- **Subset**: Check if one regular expression is a subset of another.
